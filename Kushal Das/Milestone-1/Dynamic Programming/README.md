# Defination
Technique for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler (could be because of reduced parameters) subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions. The next time the same subproblem occurs, instead of recomputing its solution, one simply looks up the previously computed solution, thereby saving computation time at the expense of a (hopefully) modest expenditure in storage space. (Source: Wikipedia)

This technique is used where the subproblems (breaking into two smaller problems) overlap.
