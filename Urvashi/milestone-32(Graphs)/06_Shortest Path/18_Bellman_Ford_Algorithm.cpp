Bellman Ford Algorithm...

What is Bellman Ford Algorithm?
=> It is also the shortest path algorithm like dijkstra algorithm. It is used to find the shortest path
from source to destination node including all the vertices using V-1 edges.

Similarity between dijkstra and bellman ford algorithm is:-
=> They both will not work in case of negative edge weight cycle in the graph.

Difference between dijkstra and bellman ford are:-
1. time complexity for dijkstra is ElogV but for bellman ford is V*E as we will do relaxing V times for E edges.
2. Dikstra algorithm can't tell us that there is a negative edge cycle in graph but bellman ford will tell it.

If after doing Vth no of relaxing we will get any change in any of the vertice then there exits negative edge
cycle.

            // checking for the condition for relaxing.
            /* firstly try to understand what is relaxing ?
            =>  Relaxing means updating the minimum cost to include a vertice in our graph if we find 
            a better path of less cost.

            So, conditions for relaxing will be:-
            1. cost should not be infinity.
            2. And we will do relaxing only if we get a edge with lesser cost.
