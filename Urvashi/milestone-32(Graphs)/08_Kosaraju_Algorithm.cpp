 Kosaraju Algorithm..

What is Kosaraju Algorithm?
=> It is used to find the strongly connected components in a graph.
Strongly connected components are the parts of graph in which there is path from every node to every other node.

Time compexity:- O(v^3)

Steps to be followed:-
1. Fistly we will do dfs of the graph and will store it in a stack.
2. Then we will reverse every single connection's direction means if connection was U->V then we will make it 
V->U. Reversing the direction of edge directions for the whole graph is called its transpose.
3. Now, we will use the property of the SCC that is transpose of SCC is equal to SCC. So, after taking the 
transpose we will traverse the graph again using DFS2 and will see the portions where DFS work correctly .
So, all those portions are called SCCs and where the DFS break it means we have to restart our DFS.
