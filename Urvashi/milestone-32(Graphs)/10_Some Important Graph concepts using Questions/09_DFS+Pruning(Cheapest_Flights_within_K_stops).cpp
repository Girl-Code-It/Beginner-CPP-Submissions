/* (https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/) 

Time complexity:- (V+E) where V is the no of vertices and E is the no of edges.

We are applying dfs + Pruning in this Problem.

Approach:-We have to find minimum fare but the condition is that the stops coming between source and destination should be atmost K.
So, we will calculate fare or one path from source to destination and will store it. Then if at while calculating fare for any other
path if we are getting more fare at any stop between source and destination then we will not calculate fare further for that path.
and this is called pruning.

We will go through each stop coming in our path and at every stop we will reduce the value of k by 1.
