/* (https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/) 

Time complexity:- O(E) where E is the no of edges and because we are travelling every edge only once.

Approach:- We have to iterate the route in lexicographical order . we have to return the route with lowest order.
So, we will make graph and traverse through each and every vertice and will go to their adjacent nodes and will 
return the path in which our lexicographical order is lowest.

We will take a multiset to maintain the lexicographical order of the adjacency lists of every vertice.

We will take a map to directly access a particular node by its key in O(1) time.
