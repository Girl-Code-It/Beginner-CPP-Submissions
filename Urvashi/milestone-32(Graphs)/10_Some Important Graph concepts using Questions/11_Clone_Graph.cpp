/* (https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)

Time complexity:- O(V*E) where V is the no of vertices and E is the no of edges.

Approach:- As we have to make a deep copy of the given graph so we will take a visited array to store the value of the node
which we have visited. And if adjacent node of some vertice is stored in visited array then we will not visit it again 
we will just put that node in the adjacency list of that vertice.
