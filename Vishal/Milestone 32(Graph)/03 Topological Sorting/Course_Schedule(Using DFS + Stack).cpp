    I have multiple solution for this questions. I am discussing all solutions.

    Solution 1: Detect A Cycle in directed Graph.

    How do we think, this solution ?
    If you plot all prerequiste, you will see a graph pointed toward a vertex. As, it is pointed, means it is directed.
    Now if we got a cycle in directed graph. What does this implies? 

    Yes, It implies, we need to take course 1 for completing course 2 and need course 2 to complete course 1.
    Which is'nt possible. So as long as we find a cycle we will return false. if there is no cycle, then return true.
    I have written code already to detect a cycle. So please check 04_Detect_cycle_in_a_directed_graph.cpp in same folder.

    Solution 2: Topological Sorting
    I will discuss topological sorting in new file. You can think how topological sorting can apply here.(As an exercise)

    Solution 3: Kahn's Algorithm
    If we complete all courses then return true else return false. Check comments (It is not most optimized solution but it is shortest)
