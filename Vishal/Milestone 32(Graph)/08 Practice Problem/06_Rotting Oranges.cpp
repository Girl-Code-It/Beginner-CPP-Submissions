// https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/

/* Solution :

    Two Cases :
    1. All oranges can't be rotted.
    => This will happen iff we have disconnected component.
    
    2. All oranges will rotted after some time.
    => So, we need a minimum time. We can find minimum time using BFS.
